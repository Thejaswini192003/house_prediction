                                                  House Price Prediction
Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset that includes various features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes. By applying machine learning algorithms, we can create a model that estimates house prices based on the provided features.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following key features:

    Size: Total area of the house in square feet.
    Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.
    Location: Categorical variable indicating the location of the house (e.g., city, neighborhood).
    Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
    Age: Age of the house in years.
    Parking: Availability of parking spaces (e.g., yes/no).
    Condition: Overall condition of the house (e.g., new, good, needs renovation).
    
Results
(Includes
1. Data pre-proccessing ,
2. Data cleaning
3. EDA
4. Model building
5. Training and testing the data
6. The model evaluation.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of predicting house prices based on various features. Future work could include refining the model, exploring more complex algorithms, or incorporating additional data sources.
